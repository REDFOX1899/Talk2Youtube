0,The Ease and Freedom of Letting Go," Now I get to just acknowledge there's an intelligence which is just bringing possibilities to awareness There's one possibility couldn't enough homeless in two-zone air bridge interesting good to know and I don't need to feed that vicious cycle by saying oh, yes, that's terrible. Oh, no. It's so scary Oh, no, it's definitely gonna happen. I could just say thank you for bringing that to my attention and I can Let go now one fear that I know some people I can't address all the possible fears that people might have and today, but I don't know the one thing that one thing that some people will have a concern about is They say well, but if I'm just letting go if I'm not doing the thing that I've always done then Then aren't I going to end up toothless and homeless on a bridge aren't I going to end up? Isn't my lover going to leave me and isn't my body going to just fall apart? You know if I'm not withing myself like I've always done then bad things will happen Well, just notice that that old way of doing things As I've already pointed out it's just feeding into the vicious cycle by virtue of the law of attention So you just keep putting attention on the thing that you don't want you get more of it even You can notice that It's never put you in a position to actually achieve what you want Right, I mean that's just about telling the truth you it's always kept you stuck Always trying to solve the problem But it's never allowed you to actually step into the light and be free of That old pattern just kept you stuck in the old pattern so just imagine then how it might be to live from a place of the ease and freedom of letting go It actually Unleashes the energy Now of course there are some other maybe unintended consequences of this all of which are good But might not initially seem so great because they involve change so as you practice letting go then you may find that some of the old beliefs and attitudes that you've held some of the identities that you've held Which were necessary in order to keep the old patterns locked in place will start to release and in that openness you might Not be sure who you are or what you want or what you believe or More likely is you would start to become aware of things that are true things that you do want that might seem a little Scary on some level because You might not be sure how to allow that to work with the rest of your life So my recommendation is go slowly don't remember don't try to be forceful be gentle with the whole process and No interest and this is a bigger topic that I'm about to Open up which won't go into in detail but no interest that there is Intelligence which is I'll say operating through you and as you"
